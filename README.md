View a live example of the [age verification widget](https://www.hoptimisticbrews.com/).

## Installation
1. Log into Squarespace. 
2. Using the side Navigation, select `Website` > `Website Tools` > `Code Injection`.
3. Copy the contents of `index.html` to the `Header` section in Code Injection.

## Configuration
You can configure the following options of the Popup:

### 1. Popup Text
Change the text within the tags on lines `59` and `60` to your desired message for the popup.
```
<h3>Are you over 18?</h3>
<p>Please confirm you are over the UK legal drinking age of 18 to continue.</p>
```

### 2. URL when No is Pressed
On Line `81` you can configure the destination when the "No" button is pressed. By default, it directs users to the Drink Aware website. To amend this, simply replace the URL with your preferred destination.

```
window.location.href = 'https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/facts/information-about-alcohol/alcohol-and-the-law/buying-alcohol#under18s';
```

### 3. Cookie Expiry
Each time a user clicks "Yes" on the popup, a cookie is stored on their device. This cookie will expire after a set period, prompting the user again. The default expiry is 24 hours. To modify this, replace `24` on line `89` with your desired number of hours (e.g., 48 for 2 days, 72 for 3 days, etc.). Ensure the other values remain unchanged.

```
date.setTime(date.getTime() + (days*24*60*60*1000));
```
